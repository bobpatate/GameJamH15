What a beautiful night, you can clearly see stars in the sky. But... this strange feeling. You feel the wind all over you. Looking around, you understand you are actually falling into bare rocks. Your companions just mocked of you and pushed you. Soon enough, you meet these rocks... but hey, everything's fine. You're not hurt, you're already dead.
This time, you're determined. They will not bully and scare you anymore. They'll see you can make kids scream out loud too.
What a coincidence, kids are going to a so-called haunted forest to test their courage. Let's haunt this forest for real.
